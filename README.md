# "Bounce" BUAS Intake Assignment
Programming assignment for BUAS intake based on theme "Bounce".

## Game Description

You are a dodgeball which can turn into a rock and a balloon. Dodgeballs bounce. Rocks falls fast. Balloons fly. Avoid spikes and reach the finish line. Game idea is roughly based on "Bounce Tales" for Nokia.

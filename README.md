# "Bounce" BUAS Intake Assignment
Programming assignment for BUAS intake based on theme "Bounce".

## Game Description

You are a dodgeball which can turn into a rock and a balloon. Dodgeballs bounce. Rocks falls fast. Balloons fly. Avoid spikes and reach the finish line. Game idea is roughly based on "Bounce Tales" for Nokia.

I have experience coding and making games (with a preexisting game engine), but I do not have experience creating without one purely on Visual Studio. Therefore, I used online tutorials to get myself started.
